@dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access\n control mechanisms.

Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n {_setRoleAdmin}.\n WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n grant and revoke this role.
